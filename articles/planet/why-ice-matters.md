As an aquatic creature, I would like to highlight that I am not a particular fan of ice. I can’t live in it. It takes up space. And while some of us do well in colder temperatures, it’s important to realize that still does not make me want to live on top of an ice slab. My name is Zelda, and I am the brand ambassador and acquisitions director here at Apazed, and I am an octopus. I am here to say that despite my dislike of ice, it is very important.

Now, I would be remiss to mention: Ice is dangerous. Cold weather is dangerous for all sorts of forms of life, and it’s part of why everything settles where it does in the world. Humanity has taken great strides over the centuries in both using, controlling, and managing ice. Ice is not exclusively dangerous, however: it’s helpful in creating sterile environments, making medicine, developing sensitive technology, and for having a refreshing drink after a hot day! It is what makes settling into extremely hot climates more tolerable.

Part of what we see now though, is that our climates are getting a bit more extreme. Weather seems to be becoming more volatile. Record breaking snowfalls, hurricanes, storms, heat waves, and the like seem to be becoming more common. This has caused scientists to grow concerned, and are trying to find solutions to the problem.

The good news is that the Earth has some built in defense systems. Things like plants, and trees. Also contributing to this defense is the Earth’s oceans. The underwater plant life does a fair bit of work in helping combat the carbon battle. In many similar ways, the ocean plant life captures carbon, and then converts it into oxygen. If you have seen those enclosed underwater terrariums, you might recognize that. For the plants to be able to live, they need a bit of light, but they also need some kind of animal life in the terrarium as well. The fish need the plants, in order to still maintain sustainable levels of oxygen in the water. It’s a very carefully balanced ecosystem, and if that sort of science is interesting to you, I would encourage you to check it out. My understanding is very basic, so I may have been off in my conclusions, but I do hope you will have fun with the research!

The other major defense that the ocean provides is an isolation strategy. While the warmer climates of the ocean are busy working towards transforming carbon into oxygen, the polar ice caps have a different approach. They are the prison wardens of carbon. Recent studies suggest that the ice caps have actually capture huge chunks of carbon into their ice. As the ice was forming, carbon was bound up into it. Which is great news in fighting against carbon, as it means there is another source to join in the fight! The problem is, Earth has not been the most kind to it’s ice caps.

As you are probably aware, the temperature at the ice caps has been a subject of much debate, and concern, in dealing with climate change. Large chunks of the ice caps have been breaking apart, and drifting and melting. While this is cause for alarm in terms of flooding in places near various water sources (such as oceans, or even rivers), it also means that there is a chance that more carbon is being released in the atmosphere.

Now, as doom and gloom as this all has sounded, I do not want to leave you out in the cold. The good news is that some of the damage that has been done is being slowly healed. For many many years, humanity was eroding the layer of protective gases around the polar caps, which helped keep the regions cooler. To put it in other terms of what humans were doing, we can think of it like teeth: the earth was drinking a lot of soda, but never brushing it’s teeth, and so it wore down the enamel to the teeth. Obviously, there is going to be pain associated with that sort of behavior, eventually! Luckily, humanity wised up. Through various decisions, even stemming as far back as the 1980’s, the ozone layer is healing. Now, there are occasions that holes form in the ozone, through different powerful weather fronts and winds that disrupt the layer. In 2020, there was an instance of a massive hole that had appeared in the ozone gases, but after a couple of weeks, the weather front moved on, and the hole sealed itself.

These sorts of decisions, and efforts, are part of why our organization Apazed has started to use [Stripe Climate](https://stripe.com/climate). It has allowed us to continue to operate our business in a normal fashion, while simultaneously allowing us to contribute to the fight against carbon.

One of the technologies and companies that Stripe Climate supports is [Carbon Cure](https://www.carboncure.com/). Carbon Cure takes the idea of the ice cap carbon storage, and turns it into a building material. Basically, they take concrete, and pump carbon into the concrete! The results are two fold: first, it captures the carbon effectively, as the concrete binds itself to the carbon creating a different mixture. But the carbon is not merely contained, it is now used! You might think adding gas to concrete would make it weaker, but as described on the Carbon Cure website, it actually makes it stronger! This new mixture can actually make the concrete upwards of 10% stronger than where it was previously.

This is encouraging for me for a variety of reasons. In the first, it is good to see people taking efforts to take care of our oceans. I live there after all! In the second, it shows that we are able to learn and adapt. We have taken an idea that is present in nature, that is to isolate the carbon, and then deployed it in a practical way that not only deals with a problem, but improves our lives as well. And finally, it is just plainly good business. We are so desperately trying to find ways to reduce, remove, and control carbon, that we can now include it fairly quickly into this sort of product! 

In many ways, that is part of why this carbon issue is so interesting. There is not only room for innovative solutions to help manage it, but there is room to turn carbon into pieces of our lives that are both beneficial, and useful!  We at Apazed want to do our part both in helping the climate, and our customers lives. We want to make your use and access to the Stripe payment platform as easy as possible for both you, and your customers, so that you can connect easier.
