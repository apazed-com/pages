Title: The Invading Octopus

Hello fellow earth dwellers!

Over the last few articles, I have been telling you about the dangers climate change pose to the oceans, as well as to humanity. This time, I, Zelda the octopus, would like to give you some advanced notice. While I am still the acquisitions director, and the brand ambassador here at Apazed, I cannot overlook my role and position as an octopus.

The Sydney Octopus is on the verge of invasion.

Before we all rush to our bunkers, it’s important to note: this isn’t a malicious act. The Sydney Octopus, primarily living around Australia, is beginning to spread their tentacles into the South Pole. The reason it is able to do so is that the habitat around the South Pole is beginning to warm enough that they can live there.

Moreover, their current lifespan of the Sydney Octopus makes it particularly good at both moving, due to currents around Australia, and adapting, due to the short life span and birth cycle.

Now, there are a lot of theories about what the consequences of this could be. It could mean that the Sydney Octopus begins to behave like it’s more cold weather adapted cousins, and grow larger, and live longer. While that initially may seem like a positive, because who doesn’t love a longer life, it could have a dire consequence.

They could lose the ability to adapt in the process.

That would then make them in the same situation as the rest of the arctic animals that have already rapidly shrinking habitats. The problem with them moving has a huge ramifications beyond their own personal survival though.

In the first place, were they to move to this southern habitat, they could become invasive. In essence, they may be able to overrun the South Pole, as their normal predators would not be as present, and their lifespans may grow longer. Though it would be a wild exaggeration, it would not be unbelievable to imagine the South Pole as less of an ice cream cone, and more like a bowl of ramen!

Can you imagine trying to live in that sort of situation? It would be uncomfortable, especially for the aquatic life already settled in the South Pole. The arrival of these travelers could spell the end for a few different species of fish that are already struggling to adapt and survive in the current conditions. And the bad news is, it’s slowly been happening for the past 60 years. Tracking and research shows that the warm water currents near Australia have begun to swoop further and further South towards the ice cap. This is as climate change gets warmer, slowly turning the South Pole into a “home away from home” for these cephalopods.  Traditionally, the Sydney Octopus lives around the eastern portion of Australia, but as the waters to the south get warmer, and the currents allow it to drift further south, their territory has slowly expanded.

We can’t stop the octopus from traveling. I can’t just call them all up, and tell them to cancel the move. In truth, most of them are just following the flow of the water for the first couple months of their life, drifting in the current.

As is only good and proper, I would like to share with you my source of information! [This article] (https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/will-climate-change-bring-an-invasion-of-the-octopuses-mdash-or-halt-it/) by Katherine Courage has great insight on the plight of the octopus. Moreover, she seems to be a fan of us all, and I find that to be quite good news! Give her article a read and check out some of her other works while you are at it!

What we can do, however, is work towards preventing the South Pole being so appealing for the octopus to live in! [Stripe Climate] (https://stripe.com/climate) is working with a number of different groups, to raise funds to help combat climate change, and prevent effects like this! 

One of the efforts being supported through Stripe Climate is called [Climeworks] (https://www.climeworks.com/). The technology and method of their carbon removal is all about taking carbon from the air, and trapping it deep in the earth.

It works along these lines, in that they have large carbon collectors that are constantly pulling in carbon. The carbon is then pressured down into the earth and mixed with other elements to turn from a gas into a carbon material. That material is then sealed away, now that is bound as a mineral as opposed to a gas. The other fact is that the inner layer of the earth has tons of storage capacity for carbon, and is relatively accessible for us to use. All of this is in an effort for our carbon footprint to be moved to carbon neutral, or even begin undoing the years of carbon output from before.

The good news is that the technology is there, and it is working. The problem is that, alongside many of the other carbon solutions, scaling is difficult. Based on the sources presented on their website, we are within 9% of the maximum amount of carbon budget we can support. But Climeworks technology, backed by Microsoft’s plan, shows that their work can take us away from that edge!

That’s where Apazed, and businesses like yours come in! By using Stripe Climate, we are able to set an amount of our revenue per transaction to go towards Stripe Climate. Set up is simple, and the personal effects feel painless. Yet, we can know that we are doing a bit more to help fight off the dangerous effects of carbon for all manner of life on Earth.

It may seem like things are quite dire when it comes to the climate, and carbon. Thankfully, there are viable solutions for us to employ and work through! As for my job, it’s all about building connections. I want to connect you with this information, use Apazed to help connect you with Stripe for your payments, and use Stripe to help you connect to your customers in an easier fashion! What can I say, I’m just a social cephalopod with time on her tentacles!
