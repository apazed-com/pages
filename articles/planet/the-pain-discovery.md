My name is Zelda the octopus, and this may come as a shock to some of you, but I can actually experience pain. Now, I can understand where the confusion comes from. Often times with other aquatic creatures, we assume that they do not have the ability to experience pain in the same way that humans do. This is an area of a great deal of study, and has a lot to do with neuroscience and behavioral understanding. Which is a lot of work to be able to accurately measure, what at times feels like it can merely be intuited.

For example, an octopus can experience pain.

In the interest of science though, allow me to walk through what [this article](https://academictimes.com/octopuses-can-feel-pain-both-physically-and-subjectively/?T=AU) written by Miles Martin, explains. The basic idea is this: is an octopus aware and able to respond to pain enough to not only move away from the initial pain, but also to avoid the location in which the pain occurred. There was a chamber in which the octopuses were starting in, and in that location, they were experiencing pain. The study describes it as a similar sensation of lemon juice in a paper cut. Painful, but not precisely harmful.

In another chamber, they were moved to, and received a pain reducer. There, while the pain was being relieved, the octopus was observed to groom itself in a self comforting practice.

Here is where the experiment really takes off: the octopuses were then allowed to explore four chambers. One that was associated with pain, two with no associations, and one associated with comfort.

The octopuses who had been exposed to pain in the initial chamber showed an aversion to the chamber, and would avoid it. They also showed a preference towards the comforting chamber. Moreover, the control group, who had experienced neither pain nor comfort, showed no particular preference to any of the chambers.

Why all of this work to find out if the octopus has enough brain power to know pain, and recognize that there is an association with the space it is in and the pain it experienced? It boils down to how we handle experiments in the future.

Animal testing is something that happens in human science, and it is a very complicated subject to begin to divulge into. One of the important components of this experimentation is that there are ethics attached to it. Generally speaking, proper science does not desire to unduly harm creatures, and that they be treated well. 

This sort of test shows that, at the very least, the octopus is aware enough to know it is in a location that it has had a previous experience, and that this knowledge can cause the octopus distress. That can have huge ramifications of what occurs within a scientific setting. It means that certain tests and procedures need to be more thought out when dealing with the octopus for starters. We are not unthinking and unfeeling creatures, but we have aversions, and memory, that directs how we respond to stressors.

It also impacts how we view invertebrates as a whole. While it is not hard to believe that we octopuses are among the more intelligent of the invertebrates, this study shows that at least some invertebrates have cognitive functions that enable more advanced thinking.

There are lots of studies that are being done about animals and their thinking ability. One study being done is related to dogs, and their language comprehension. (This article)[https://www.theverge.com/21557375/bunny-the-dog-talks-researchers-animal-cognition-language-tiktok] written by Kait Sanchez describes the experiment involving Bunny, and a number of other dogs. I will admit to you, I follow Bunny’s instagram ( @whataboutbunny ), because honestly her antics and adventures make me laugh.

Either way, there is a huge amount of study and research about what goes on in the minds of animals. Moreover, that research is important because it gives us valuable insight into the lives and needs of the rest of the planet. This is a huge step for humanity, and I am personally excited to see where it leads. While I doubt that it will be the beginning of a large-scale, cross-species scientific laboratory, an octopus can dream, right? (Studies show that we can!)

In a more practical sense, this will begin to allow us to handle experiments and scientific discovery in a more ethical way. While studies and at times painful experiences are part of scientific exploration, there are ways to make discoveries that do not have to involve creatures being terrified. We simply need to know what the creatures are able to experience, in order to understand how their minds work.
