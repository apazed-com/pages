There are a ton of reasons to be concerned about climate change. As an ocean dweller, there are particular concerns for me that will inevitably also impact you. The ocean and the lives of the rest of the planet are connected! These consequences are easy to overlook, and happen somewhat slowly, but it is being felt across the globe. Before we can explain what [Stripe Climate](https://stripe.com/climate) is doing to combat this issue, I would like to highlight what is happening.

One of the primary issues to think through when it comes to the changes in temperature, in regards to the ocean, is the idea of food. Food for animals, as well as food for humans. Tons and tons of people know about the importance of temperature, rain, and some are even aware of soil conditions in terms of growing vegetables. Plants have to have certain requirements met. Humans don’t go around planting crops in the deep cold winters, not usually at least. That’s because the plants won’t be able to get the needed nutrients, sunlight, and temperatures, to grow well.

The same thing is true about fish, algae, coral, and all the other creatures and plants in the ocean. Each of these beings has become an expert at survival, growth, and life, in their traditional locations in the ocean. As water temperature goes up, their food sources begin to dwindle. Algae under the ice caps can’t develop if the ice is missing. If the algae isn’t there, then the fish that depend on it begin to have to compete for food, and their population drops. That leads to the larger creatures of the food chain to have to compete for food as well.

It isn’t all animal based problems for food either. As the temperature changes, it makes the population of other fish struggle as well. As the temperature begins to go up, some fish have begun to have difficulties with reproduction. This is an important thing to consider, when you recognize the livelihoods that are dependent upon catching and selling fish, and more so when you consider the weight fish carries in the supply of food to humanity.

There is also the issue that fish will begin to migrate. Now, migration in and of itself is not bad. The trouble is that we are not entirely certain where the fish will end up going to try and survive. The habitats that many aquatic life need are threatened by the sheer temperature of the water. This can be seen in how it impacts the coral reefs.

Coral is many things: colorful, shelter, beautiful, and fragile. One of the surprising things about coral reefs is how delicate they are. From an outside perspective, coral almost seems like strange, even exotic, rocks. The truth however, is that coral is alive. Currently, coral reefs are in danger because of the temperature at which they need to survive. Their tough exterior hides that these reefs are actually extremely delicate. Moreover, this is why touching coral is generally considered to be a bad thing. When pressure is applied to the coral, the coral itself can puncture it’s inner layers, and die. There is plenty of reason to care about coral, but in this instance, we care about it because it provides a necessary shelter and habitat for a huge swath of the different fish species in the ocean. The problem is that, when coral dies, it stops growing, and no longer functions as a shelter. Those fish will have to find different places to live, and as the habitats become more scarce, they will likely die out. This has huge implications for the people who live near the ocean.

Speaking of living by the ocean, this issue is primarily for humanity. The sea levels are going up. Approximately 10 percent of the world’s population lives in areas that are 32 feet, or less, above sea level. Already, the people of Kiribati are having to find refuge due to the rising sea level. These sorts of issues will be all the more common for those living in island nations, but also coastal cities.


Finally, the changing temperature has started to impact the way in which the oceans work. The ocean currents are impacted by the water traveling and riding from various temperatures, and many fish, as well as weather, follow these currents. As it has gotten warmer, some the larger, and vital, currents of the ocean have begun to slow. Moreover, the issue of pollutants and factors contributing to the carbon problem, are also impacting the ocean. The chemistry of the ocean, it’s PH level, is shifting as well. Creatures that have grown to build shells, as well as the much smaller plankton, are impacted by these changes. Shells are not able to form as structures around some of these creatures, and so they become much easier prey. That boosts the predators population momentarily, but when all of those creatures are gone, they too will have to either adapt or will fall out of the food chain. Plankton, a base creature for much of the food chain, has difficulty surviving as well in this different kind of ocean.

Now, admittedly, for an octopus like me, this feels like a ton. This does not mean that everything is lost, however. Stripe, through their Stripe Climate initiative, are doing a great deal to support those combating the change. I would like to introduce you to [Project Vesta](https://www.projectvesta.org/). What Project Vesta aims to do is to help the ocean do what it does naturally. They take volcanic material, and introduce it to beaches. The waves hit the material, and slowly wears it down. As it wears down, the materials begin to capture CO2, and in the process, turn into limestone, and drifts down into the ocean floor. The ocean has done this for billions of years, but this way helps accelerate it’s process!

I would be remiss to not mention: none of this is my personal research. I, Zelda the octopus, have had to rely on others for this information. While these are things I have observed, the credit belongs here: [5 ways that climate change affects the ocean](https://www.conservation.org/blog/5-ways-that-climate-change-affects-the-ocean) written by Jessica Pink, as the primary place of information, and Project Vesta, as described above. We at Apazed are trying to do our part by joining Stripe Climate, and it is my pleasure to use my tentacles to help you connect with resources, and your clients, with ease!
