# Closing the Deal

I don’t know about you, but for me, payments can be a bit tricky. I cannot tell you how many of my friends use different apps for payments. You have Venmo, PayPal, Google, and on down the line it goes. Where possible, I’ll do cash, because it is simpler.

But in online transactions, cash is slow. Extremely slow. It is unheard of today in the world of online commerce, to send a cash payment via mail. At the same time, it can feel overwhelming to try and keep up with every way to make payments. There is almost always some new payment option, some way to trade, that has cropped up and is the hot new thing.

What is a simple, online octopus and business owner, to do?

The answer is simple: Stripe can accept a TON of different ways to process payments. And Apazed offers a way to put Stripe into your website. But we are biased. Let me explain a bit further about why this is important.

Around Christmas time, I went looking around for some gifts to get for friends and to mail them. The trouble is, a bunch of the websites I was browsing on wanted me to make accounts, sign up for mailing lists, and I am a bit over making all of these accounts. So, instead, I ended up going through Amazon for a couple of them. Not just because it was the mailing, but because I knew to some degree that Amazon is trustworthy enough. I knew how they handled payments, and understood all I needed about getting the product in a timely fashion. They have built trust with me, and I don’t have to put in a ton of work to get it.

To put it another way, I want you to consider the world of streaming right now. Not like, personal streamers on twitch, but like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and all the others. Doesn’t it all feel a bit much right now? And then another show comes out, and you might think to yourself “Wow! That show looks really good!” But then you realize it’s coming out on a whole different streaming service. You end up asking the question “Is this really worth the effort? Is this really another service I need?”

The same is true for all of our online business. We as sellers need to ensure that we are not making it difficult for our customers to buy. If there is some kind of barrier, such as account making, needing an app they don’t have, or even a questionably secure site, you are asking the customer to answer a couple questions.

“How worth it is this product to me?” In the world of the internet, especially just starting out, the answer to that is likely going to be ‘not very much’. It is a harsh reality to face, but there are often other players on the field. Within a few seconds, people are deciding on the accessibility of our products, their personal need for the product, and if not, can they get it elsewhere.

There are three things you can do to counteract these issues:

### 1) Be incredibly accessible

In terms of being accessible, going through Stripe seems to be one of the best ways about it. They accept a GIANT list of payment styles and processes, and can help make the process of payment much simpler. With Apazed, getting Stripe installed and usable for your website has never been easier. You do not have to be a tech-guru in order to get Stripe functioning, with all of the capabilities you need.

### 2) Be honest with your product

Not everyone who looks at your product is going to need it. This is not something we actively acknowledge, but it may be worth thinking about. In my understanding, it is better to be upfront with your product's capabilities, and what it does, than trying to ‘kind of, maybe, work’ for a customer’s need. Why? Because if they are making do, they won’t recommend your product. But if they can know exactly what they are getting, and it lives up to that expectation, you are going to get a huge payout of advertising.

### 3) Prove your service

Finally, in the world of online sales, everyone is expecting to get scammed. At least, most people are. Now, frequently people still do, which is tragic. One of the best defenses to building your customers trust, is actual customer trust. In terms of Kickstarter, I am more likely to back a product if: they have had success in the past, their reviews are higher, and the product is something I want. All of that gets circumvented if I know the person through some kind of media platform though, or have known them face to face on some level. You need to be able to point to small things, even things that may not be conscious to the buyer, that you are trustworthy. Your site is easy to navigate. Your payment options are clear. You have good customer reviews, or you have excellent communication with potential customers. Basically, take everything that you want answered, or want to do before you buy something online and then: do those things.

Our goal is to try and make it easier for you to connect with your customers! If you are able to set yourself up as a trustworthy site, and people are able to make payments easily, the last two bits are: your product itself, and getting your name out there. It’s a bit of an art, a bit of a science, and at times a heap of luck. But we want to try and help you in that endeavor! Don’t get overwhelmed by the task, it is our desire to help you make a payment site that is easily accessible. And, perhaps more importantly now then ever, just keep swimming, and keep connecting! It’s been rough waters for a while now, but you have made it this far. Keep going!
