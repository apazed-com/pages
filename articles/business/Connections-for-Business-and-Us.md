Title: Connections for Business and Us


You might be curious as to what an octopus would do when employed as both a brand ambassador and as the acquisitions director. To put it simply, my job is to make connections with others! My name is Zelda Joy, octopus, and I am here to help you connect more readily with your customers.

Before this previous year, we made connections constantly. Connections and encounters with people were frequent, and constant. Over this past year, we have likely gained some insights on what it means to be around others. This goes for the important relationships in our lives, to even the passing acquaintance. My job is to make sure that the connections that we at Apazed make are positive. But before we go any further, I don’t want to lead you down the wrong path. The foundation of a healthy and good business transaction, and even other connections, is born from this positive space. I want our connections to be positive, in and of themselves. If we do, or do not, do business, I want the encounter to be positive. I’m not foolish enough to believe that every interaction I will be at my best, nor do I have such a large head as to believe that my presence is the singular friendly moment in the day. However, I do want the dealings that I take part in to be positive either way.

In the first place, it is important to treat people well. The connections that we have with others carry some impact and weight on day to day life. I do not know what kind of day or life the people around me have. So, why not lean towards the positive?

Moreover, it is straight up good business. I was speaking with a friend recently, about their interactions with a company. There was an error in delivery, and this caused a great deal of frustration. Rather than keep my friend updated and informed on the situation, he quickly felt ignored, which led to concerns on the reliability of the business he was working with.

We can avoid this! Once that connection has been made, follow up is important.

Beyond preventing problems, it can create more business. When your customers have had a good experience, and when you have provided them a service that has helped them in a meaningful way, they are likely to tell others about it. Frequently, an individual has others in their lives facing a similar issue. For example, I collect dice! My friends also enjoy dice, and will ask me on where to get dice, in various styles and price ranges. I couldn’t tell you how many people I have brought into my dice habits, by simply saying “Would you like to look at my new dice set, I got it from…”. The same is true for all sorts of problems. People have communities and connections, and you have built a reputation from your service! Make sure the connections that you have are positive.

Finally, I want to bring up something that is oftentimes missed, but has been highlighted over the past year. People truly do need connections. Some less than others, but it is true. Having healthy connections with others is important for mental and emotional well being. It has even been tied to the physical health of people, as meaningful connection is able to strengthen the body in response to stress. There is a reason why so many shows build upon the basis of connections! It is part of the reason why counseling and therapy are such important and beneficial services in a society. People need these connections, and so do businesses.

Here are some tips on building stronger connections:

1. Try to figure out who you are trying to reach. Have a picture in mind of what the customer is like: each business will have a different approach. For a car mechanic, it’s going to be a person who is having car problems, and they need to know about the business before it is actually time for repairs. For a technical service, it is going to be someone seeking a very specific issue. Understanding who is likely going to be looking for your services, helps you to prepare for what their needs are!

2. “Customer service with a smile” is a cliche. It is all well and good to be friendly and chatty, but earnest customer service goes a long distance as well. Clarifying what troubles the customer is experiencing, how you can help, and what steps you are actively taking are a big deal.

3. Find appropriate means to follow up! If it was a more personalized service, a quick: “Hey, I just wanted to make sure your issue was resolved, and that everything is good to go!” Can mean a lot. Even if it is an automated situation, and they don’t respond, it signifies that you are interested in their care of service. For products that have been bought, I have gotten ‘extra’ bits from sellers: things like stickers, business cards, candy, etc. These gestures are generally appreciated, and create a sticking point in my mind. Going back to the dice, I regularly get email follow ups that announce their new rotations, and availability. I check it frequently, to see what I might get!

4. Make the most with what tools you have. You may not have the strongest website, or the cleanest email, or even the absolute best product in the world. Do with it what you can. You may not have the strongest know-how on advertising, or social media presence. That’s ok! Even just a bit is worth doing.
