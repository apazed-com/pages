There is a common misconception that humans carry, that squids and octopuses are interchangeable. We are not! My name is Zelda, the brand ambassador and acquisitions director of Apazed, and also an octopus. I would like to clear up some of the squids in culture, and primarily, how generally speaking they are not representative of the octopus.

I will admit to you, space is an intimidating place. As we are all aware, space is massive, gigantic, and feels unknown. In truth, it feels about as alien as it can get for us. It only stands to reason that the same thing humans did with the depths of the ocean, they also did with the vastness of space. Specifically, humans have filled it with monsters. Plentiful times in history did humans describe the giant squid, or a kraken, as a threat to ships that never returned. There is a fairly common idea out in culture about the idea of space creatures, or space aliens. Many times, space creatures are imagined to have two attributes that we cephalopods do: tentacles, and an unsettling intelect. In terms of tentacles, it’s true. I, as an octopus, have tentacles that are similar to squids. Often, aliens are depicted to have these as sort of a moustache arrangement on the more humanoid varieties. In other ways, these aliens are presented not only to be visually reminiscent of the octopus, but also in the nature of their minds. Aliens are presented frequently as wildly different, with minds that are frighteningly different from humanity’s. This is a fear often associated with cephalopods of the deep. I believe I could make an argument that these alien creatures are more likely to be squids than they are an octopus however. While both the octopus and squid are classified as invertebrates because we lack a backbone, squids still have a skeletal structure! Moreover, as an octopus it is much more likely that I am closer to the seafloor, than I am the open ocean. I would not be well suited to floating about, unlike squids which tend to have an easier time navigating open water. For those reasons, I think if there were space creatures, especially cephalopodic in nature, they would be closer to the squid than the octopus.

Another piece of culture that has taken on the characteristics of the octopus: Dr. Octavius, or “Doc Ock'', or “Dr. Octopus'',  from Spider-Man. I can understand why the name was chosen. It’s a play on the character’s initial name. He is a scientist, and as an octopus, I find it flattering to be considered a scientific creature. Unfortunately, he is also an ego-maniac and generally not a great person. I also believe he has more in common with squids than an octopus. I will concede that he does tend to work in a laboratory, and builds a den he is territorial over. That is definitely octopus behavior. Yet structurally, he is significantly different than me! In the first place, like a squid, he has a skeleton. That is more from his human nature than anything though, so that may not be evidence enough. The other piece of note is that Dr. “Octopus” tend to be depicted as having tentacles with hooks and claws. This is a huge description difference! While the octopus does not have hooks on their tentacles, squids do. While we are both capable of manipulating objects, some squid use hooks to latch onto their prey. This is a capability that is not seen in the octopus. While this does mean the squid might be more adept at opening a door, it also means that we octopuses cannot be held accountable for this madman’s crimes, even if he decided to wrongfully use our good name.

The next villain I would like you to consider is found in video games, specifically Mario games. This creature is known as a Blooper (or Bloober). These creatures tend to be stuck in the water, but have at times also been featured on land. They have tentacles, though that number is not always consistently portrayed. They do swim in the water, which is something I can do, and in a similar fashion. But there is one highlight I would like to make here as to why the Blooper is definitely a squid, and not an octopus. Their head isn’t shaped like mine! If you were to observe an octopus, you might take note of it’s head. It is quite round, and may even look a bit squishy, and generally, visually appealing (though I am biased). Now consider the head of the squid, which is shaped more like a pen, and has a more solid structure to it. One could even think of the squid as pointy. The Blooper, in fact, basically has a rounded triangle surrounding it’s head. The proof here in this creature’s heritage is in it’s head shape. Some may argue that the Blooper also shoots ink, and while that is true, both squids and octopuses release and shoot ink. It’s a trick we both have learned, and cannot be used to differentiate between us.

As a bonus, I will highlight two legendary creatures: the Kraken, and the Lusca. Many people have heard of the Kraken, and it is wrapped in all sorts of media references. Many villains carry the name, and are tied to it due to tentacles, immense strength, or adaptability to the underwater environments. While the Kraken is mythological, it is frequently presented at the idea of a squid, both in the shape of its head, and it’s attacks in the deep ocean. The Lusca, on the other hand, does tend towards being identified as an octopus. Again, it is a mythological creature. This creature is theoretical as evidence of the size of such an octopus is debated. The story of the Lusca seems to be born from the Carribean. Moreover, any attacks that the Lusca could be involved in would be in shallow water, as that would be the place an octopus would most be suited to reach and attack from. Basically, if you want to have an octopus monster, it would be properly named ‘Lusca’, and not ‘Kraken’. But again, the Lusca isn’t proven to exist in the way the media presents, even if it is overshadowed by the more popular Kraken concept.

Many of these pictures have been found on Wiki pages. I do hope that this clears up any concerns the rest of you humans have about the octopus! We really are only interested in having nice and peaceful lives in the ocean. Plus, I want to help you connect with your customers!
