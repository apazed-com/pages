There is just so much to do, and so little time to get it done! You would think with eight arms, I would be eight times as productive. It turns out, there is always more to do!

My name is Zelda, and I am the acquisition director, and brand ambassador, for Apazed. I am also an octopus. I joined Apazed.com early on in the development stages. Now, I will admit, most would think that an octopus working for Apazed is a strange circumstance indeed, but it really goes hand in tentacle.

One of the key components to my lifestyle, is that I’ve got the ability to explore. Sure, I will set up my new homebase den on the seafloor, but then I’ll explore the area. I need to know every bit and piece of information that I can about where I am at, in order to thrive! This is part of what my tentacles are for. They spread out, over the sand, in the water, along the coral reefs, and unfortunately the debris, and tell me what is out there. My tentacles help me to explore and connect to the world around me.

My whole role, and passion, is about connecting with customers. You see, our goal is to help our customers to connect to Stripe, a payment platform, so that our customers can easily connect to their own customers, and get payments! You may have heard of fiber optics, well I consider my work to be octo-optics.

I’m kidding. I would make for an absolutely terrible long term sustainable connection if used for a literal piece of infrastructure. What I can do though, is help you easily connect to your customers through the easy online payment platform Stripe, through our product Apazed.
