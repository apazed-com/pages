Now, I know that this is my job and everything. Telling you about Apazed, how it’s an amazing product, tell you about Stripe, and all that. It’s all very well and good, and I am more than pleased with it. I really want to bring your attention to something that I am passionate for as well.

Stripe is helping with a project that is near and dear to my tentacles. Carbon removal! Now, they are offering an option called [Stripe Climate!](https://stripe.com/climate]). This option is for companies that are using Stripe, to be able to direct a portion of their revenue towards the fight against climate change. It turns out, climate change has a huge impact on the oceans. That’s why I am excited to announce that we at Apazed have signed up to work with Stripe Climate as well! The process is very simple, we set a percentage amount of our revenue to go towards the fund, and it happens automatically from there with each purchase. We would love to invite you to do the same!

Now, you might think it is a bit odd that an octopus is concerned about climate change, and carbon emissions. After all, the theory is that if there is more carbon, then the planet gets warmer, the ice caps melt, and all of us cephalopods get a ton more space to live in! The trouble is that the areas we can currently live are becoming more and more inhospitable.

I will make sure to share some of that information with you in the near future, but for today, I want to continue to highlight how Striped Climate is working. In order to combat climate change, one of the most important things we can do is find ways to get rid of carbon. And there is some good news in that we have found some ways to do so! The problem is that the development of these technologies is extremely expensive. Humans are already doing a fair bit of work in the effort of combating carbon through replanting trees, and trapping carbon with soil. The trouble is that the scale to which we have to work on these issues is massive.

Some of the world’s top scientists are working diligently at developing different technologies that could help, and are even being used today. The trouble is, getting the technology out is expensive. There are solutions that exist, and can be sold, but the price is too high. Because the price is too high, there are not a ton of funds to be used in optimizing the tech, to make it cheaper. It is somewhat of a whirlpool situation, but that is where we get to step in.

What Stripe Climate is attempting to do is to help various groups develop and purchase carbon management technology. One of the patterns we have learned in development and deployment of technology and manufacturing is that as more time and purchases are made into a product, it tends towards becoming more optimized and cheaper. Stripe displays information by the Santa Fe Institute of how this pattern has emerged in solar panels, hard drives, and DNA sequencing, and believes the same is true for carbon removal.

What does this have to do with you and I? It’s somewhat simple. Chances are, we ourselves may not be able to come up with that next big technology piece to the carbon question. What we can do however, is support those that can with our individual strengths! As an octopus who excels in connections, I am trying to connect you to this information, as well as have moved Apazed to help support Stripe Climate. If you have the means to do so, would you consider also supporting Stripe Climate? Stripe itself is a great tool for helping your customers be able to pay you money, and our job at Apazed is helping you install and connect to Stripe in a seamless fashion for your business. You can help join our fight against climate change in a tangible way, by financially supporting Stripe Climate. You set a certain amount to be taken off of each transaction, and it goes to Stripe Climate. Painless, and helps position yourself into taking a more active role in the care of our planet, our oceans, and our friends and families!
