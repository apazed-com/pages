As has been discussed before, there are significant differences between the octopus and the squid. As an octopus myself,
I find it important to defend and to clear our good name. There are many villains portrayed within video games, and I
would like to highlight the nefarious acts of squids. I am not saying that all squids are evil, but what I am saying is
that these squids are, and that often the octopus gets blamed for crimes that the squid commits! Let's get into the
depths of the squid criminal empire, and stop them blotting the octopus's good name.

## 10. ‘Capamari’ from Kirby’s Epic Yarn

This one is a bit complex. In the first place, the squid-like creature may just be an octopus wearing a hat to look like
a squid. In the second, it really does seem like this creature is mainly just living its life and happens to be in the
way of the protagonist. While it is a holder of the pieces Kirby has sought after, it does feel a touch strange. But
either way, this boss packs a punch!

## 9. ‘Inklings’ from Splatoon series

While these half-kid half-squid individuals are presented as heroes in Splatoon (suspect squid propaganda), they are in
fact villains. How else is it possible that these inklings never operate for me in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, but my
competitors always find success? Cheating, that’s how.

## 8. ‘Crabsquids’ from Subnautica

Those who are paying attention will note that this creature is less pointy than the traditional squid description. It
may even lead you to believe it is an octopus. But I would highlight that it is actually included the features of a
crab. This creature has two tentacles with claws on it. Squid also exhibit having hooks on some of their tentacles,
unlike the octopus. If you find one of these swimming about in Subnautica, look out, you are in for a fight!

## 7. ‘Warpers’ from Subnautica

This creature from Subnautica is a bit more humanoid in appearance, but still carries both tentacles, and now appendages
that look like scythes. It’s role is to eliminate a disease from the planet, which may include you! They jump from place
to place, and can send you away as well. It is quite a disconcerting experience.

## 6. 'Ghasts' from Minecraft

These creatures ‘live’ within the Nether of Minecraft. It is a hellish landscape, though recently updated with a few
more pleasant biomes and entities. The Ghast, however, is a flying, crying, destructive creature. Where it’s water
brethren in the overworld merely release ink as a defense mechanism, the Ghast forgoes all semblance of civility. It
will fly about, and shoot fireballs at you, trying to destroy you, your creations, and the very ground on which you are
precariously perched. Now, if you are curious as to why I suggest they are squids, and how they are related to their
overworld companions, consider this: what happens to all of that rage and greed of the squid after it perishes? Surely
the Nether is it’s ultimate destination. (This is all just a mild joke. The ghast merely has tentacles, and is pointy,
so it is probably like a squid and not an octopus!)

## 5. ‘Squids’ from Space Invaders

Even all the way back to this video game classic we can see the squid. The squid is the medium strength and size
creature, slowly descending upon the world. It would be important to note that the octopus is also considered a higher
tier boss, but this resemblance and name are merely coincidental.

## 4. ‘Volt Kraken’ from Mega Man X5

Volt Kraken is a robot, infected by the same virus that has ravaged the robot populace of the Mega Man franchise. This
boss is characterized by his electric attacks. This squid enemy is also known to launch electrical strikes from the
tentacles attached to him. I don’t find myself envious of squid characters frequently, but I do find myself a touch
jealous of such power.

## 3. ‘The Kraken’ from Final Fantasy series

Whether in the sky, sea, or land there are plentiful amounts of squid like bosses in the final fantasy series. The
Kraken, and Octomammoth do resemble squids. Ultros on the other hand does claim to be an octopus, much to my chagrin.

## 2. ‘Big Octos’ from Legend of Zelda series

Based on the name, you might believe these creatures are octopuses. They are, in fact, imposters. You can tell because
of the shape of their heads. In Wind Waker, they live in the open ocean and cause whirlpools! In other games in the
Zelda series, they wear pointed rock like hats, and fire what I assume are rocks at the player. Truly dreadful, pesky
beasts. The misnomer of ‘octos’ has caused a great deal of controversy.

## 1. ‘Squids’ from Minecraft

![‘Squids’ from Minecraft](/2021/04/minecraft-squid-1200.webp)

You might be thinking to yourself “squids in minecraft aren’t evil!” but I would challenge that thought. These creatures
are evasive, and elusive. How often have you needed ink in minecraft, and realize: I have to go find a squid. They are
tricky to hunt down! Worse still, sometimes they will blind you with ink. Which also means they could freely give you
ink, but instead make you hunt them, and then feel guilty for it. When given the option to be generous and helpful, or
to withhold, they choose to withhold. While seemingly goofy squares with tentacles, these creatures are not to be
trusted.

And there you have it. The who's who of villainous squids in video games! I am absolutely sure there are other criminals
of the depths not on this list, but these are the ones that swam to mind first. May you always be prepared, and know the
innocence of the octopus.
