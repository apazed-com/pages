Title: The Kraken


Today, I would like to share with you a story.

Or perhaps, an examination of a story.

Let’s talk about the Kraken.

Humans are fixated on the idea of a Kraken, and it does make some level of sense. As an octopus, I know the dangers of the ocean, and some of what dwells down beneath the waves. It’s my natural habitat, and I am fairly comfortable there. The reality is that humans are not.

For thousands of years, humans have had some level of questions with the water. Some cultures outright feared it, while others learned to live alongside it. All of these cultures however, learned to respect it. From that fear, and respect, was born the idea of a Kraken.

The traditional Kraken is a squid-like creature, and impossibly large. Usually characterized with tentacles, a strong beak, and a squid shaped head, the Kraken from mythology often spells the end of a ship and crew. To put it plainly, the Kraken is the mythological embodiment of the fears tied to the ocean. The Kraken legend is something based on a creature that lurks in the depths, a creature that is large and able to take down ships, and a creature that is malicious, with an intelligence that is sharper than the average animal.

Thus was the fear of the sea given some sort of form and story.

The truly tragic part of it, from my perspective, is that the Kraken is tied to the squid, and people often believe squids and the octopus are the same thing. This is not the case! In the first place, an octopus head is nice and smooth and round. One of the more distant cousins does have some floppy fins on his head, but we try not to make fun of him about it. The squid, on the other hand, has a head that is more shaped like a pen, with two fins on the side. Moreover, as an octopus, I only have eight tentacles. The squid usually has eight tentacles, plus two more angled to the front, with some hooks attached.

I am also different from squids in the places in which I, and my brethren, live. We prefer to live along the seabed, in deep or shallow water. We build dens, and hide out there. Squids tend towards being more mobile creatures, and live in the open water, swimming about. Squids make for stronger predators because they have a bone in their head to protect them, whereas I am more vulnerable.

This is a picture of an octopus!

You can tell because it’s head looks squishy, and it’s along the ocean floor. 

This is partially why I feel it is important to distance myself from being identified as a squid, and more so, a Kraken! The Kraken would most definitely be a squid, based on descriptions of it’s behaviors.

In the first place, it has to have a hard head. Anything that is going to go toe to toe with a ship, or survive as such a large creature, is going to have to have some kind of support and protection. As for me, I’m a bit more fragile! I’ll admit, I do have the ability to hunt down food, but my process for eating is much slower, and is dependent upon my spit, as opposed to my strength of tearing things apart.

Moreover, the Kraken seems to frequently be described as having more appendages than I do. If you look at all sorts of modern tellings of fighting with Krakens, they have at least eight, but usually more, tentacles. And speaking of tentacles, their tentacles tend to be much stronger than the ones I have. They will hook onto ships, and use their raw strength to pull apart whatever they so choose. While I would love to hit the gym, and really start bulking up, as an octopus my tentacles are not as strong. We both have suckers on our tentacles, but those hooks that a squid has are really quite an advantage!

The legends of the Kraken vary, some are seen swimming and harassing ships, while others dwell at the ocean depths. As someone who has seen the depths, I can assure you, I have yet to encounter a Kraken. What I can’t verify, is that it isn’t swimming around in the water. But, I can assure you, most octopus do not do that! We stick to the sand and sea beds, where it is safer and easier for us to get food.

Mainly, I just wanted to clear the murky water here. I do not want humans dreading the ocean, nor do I want to be held for crimes by a mythological cousin of mine. I use my tentacles to explore, and yes at times to eat, but also to build connections! Where the Kraken may be thought of to be a terrifying predator, I would prefer to be thought of a social sea butterfly. While the Kraken is used as a symbol of control, and mystery, and an unknown threat, I would like to be seen as someone who is friendly and helpful! Besides, we are so strikingly different, it is surprising to me that people get us confused. I will admit, I look a bit different from a lot of the mammals on land, and the fish in the ocean. I can understand why I may be a bit intimidating. The truth is that I’m not all that dangerous, I just have a reputation before me.
