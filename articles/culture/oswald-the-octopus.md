Excerpt: Oswald features all the qualities of a young children‚Äôs show, with some light plot, friendly and bright colors, and encouraging messages by our hero.

You might be surprised about the spaces you find a cephalopod character in culture. I could think of some fairly quickly, like Squidward from Spongebob, and Doctor Octopus from Spiderman (He isn‚Äôt really an octopus, but inspired by!). Those are fairly easier ones for me, because they were in some way connected with my own personal childhood. There is one octopus that has a bit of a younger group, and his name is Oswald. 

Oswald had his own children‚Äôs show (named Oswald), on Nickelodeon, and later on Noggin and CBS. Oswald features all the qualities of a young children‚Äôs show, with some light plot, friendly and bright colors, and encouraging messages by our hero. Oswald, the large blue octopus, lives a generally happy life with his pet hotdog, Weenie. It‚Äôs a fairly adorable show, and teaches young viewers on the value of optimism, adaptability, and community. Now, I do not desire to disrupt the full plot of Oswald, but I think it is valuable to celebrate the teachings of a cephalopod who is going against some human fears of the aquatic creature.

When it comes to optimism, this seems like a strange thing to try to teach. People in many ways believe that you simply ‚Äòare‚Äô optimistic or pessimistic, but this teaching goes a bit deeper. Oswald faces challenges to his day and plans, in all sorts of ways. The problems are never dire, and realistically not hugely consequential, but enough to be frustrating for all people. For example, the first episode features a plan to go camping with friends, but it starts to rain. It‚Äôs not a grave danger, but it is disappointing. Oswald‚Äôs messaging though is about optimism in the face of challenges like this: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs raining outside, and we can‚Äôt change the rain. But maybe there is something we can do instead?‚Äù I won‚Äôt spoil the ending, but this attitude runs throughout the show. Problems can be solved. Difficulty can be overcome. This is hugely important for both children and adults today. How often have we run into adversity for the day, and it made the day become a bit of a wash? Or, more importantly, it is good to remember the scale of the problems we face. Oswald may have not been able to go camping the way he had expected, but the goal was to have fun with friends and spend time together! That is a challenge that can be easily solved!

In terms of adaptability, this is something that cephalopods of all kinds excel at, with their ability to camouflage themselves, and do some puzzle solving. Oswald is no different in this regard. Oswald combats his young viewers tendency to shut down when an obstacle is presented, or to become upset when something doesn't go the way they had planned. Instead, Oswald‚Äôs world is presented with a number of challenges, but also solutions. At some points, it is more that the problem Oswald thinks he is facing, is really a solution in disguise! Oswald learns and grows, and practices adaptability in almost every episode. Oswald teaches the young viewer that when things aren't going to plan, try a different solution, or look at it from a different perspective. Learning to be adaptable is such a vital tool for the octopus, children, and adults as well. As silly as it may seem, Oswald‚Äôs approach of openness to learn and other perspectives is valuable, even though it is a children‚Äôs show. In one instance, Oswald was decorating something for use by someone else, and put a lot of effort into it. Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond Oswald‚Äôs control, his original work of decorating was undone. The result though, was the gift was better than before, and the recipients were grateful for his thoughtful work! Oswald had the chance to be upset by things not going according to his plan, but instead celebrated that the gift was well-received anyway.

Oswald also carries the value of community. One of the struggles that some children‚Äôs shows have is they are focused very much on an individual character, and that character‚Äôs needs. So much so, that adults can perceive the main character to be whiney or self-centered. This is not the case with Oswald. Oswald makes a point of showing a small variety of characters and lives around our main star, and how Oswald helps them each with various day to day things. Moreover, Oswald lives in a somewhat abstract city. Details of the city are vague, but there are multiple instances where Oswald does something that benefits the city at large. For example, Oswald was getting rid of some old belongings, and those belongings ended up going to other residents of the city, or helping improve bits of the community for others. It isn‚Äôt all about the direct action of helping others in the community though. Oswald also helps his neighbors learn a bit about healthy boundaries, as well as respecting the differences between each other. Oswald accomplishes this task by being mindful of his friends and neighbors, while still remembering things that are important to them, such as their birthdays, or other important and special occasions.
	
In terms of contributions to the larger culture, Oswald hasn't had as wide of a splash as Squidward, or other cephalopods. But, in terms of vouching for cephalopods as a whole, Oswald is definitely heroic. Culture has a distrusting fascination with the underwater creatures, finding them both beautiful, but often refer to them with fear. Oswald distinctly helps combat that sort of stereotype. Oswald is a thoughtful and kind octopus, that I for one suggest as a good role model for all sorts of children, aquatic or not! If we were dividing all cephalopods into heroes and villains, Oswald would land firmly in the heroic category. With pleasant imagery, an attitude of perseverance, and a gentle yet adventurous attitude, Oswald is one octopus you would be missing out on as a child! Even better, Oswald‚Äôs stories are still enjoyable enough to watch as an adult too!
