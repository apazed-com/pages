Our main goal here is to help those without the development knowledge without the engineering team start getting paid *without any additional fees*. Yes, you can upgrade to a [Pro plan](https://apazed.com/pricing) in case you need a few advanced features. That said, we're not going to bait and switch you into that Pro plan, it's why we have all the best features available for you now and forever, **for free!**

Prior to Apazed, he successfully built and ran Sprout Invoices, an invoicing solution for WordPress sites. In early 2020, just before the world collapsed to COVID-19, he was led to pass it to a larger company with the resources and depth of knowledge to handle the growth.  Beyond his extensive business experience he loves baseball, so much you may find some easter eggs at Apazed.com, I've heard he's pretty good at golf too, at least that's what Zelda can't stop talking about.

Well, it is what it is, we simply hire the best people. Seriously though, it's truly not her fault you're rolling your eyes right now, that's on you. For those grinning a bit, you're the kind of joy filled friend <strike>she</strike> we want to see more of. If you'd like to read some great articles she's been writing head on over to <a href="/articles/" class="flex items-center justify-start mt-8 text-md font-medium tracking-wide text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-200 underline">articles</a>.

## What's the deal with no fees?

I don't care what they say. We will prove a sustainable business can be built to connect payment providers and site owners without the added percentage undercutting what little margin online sellers have. Currently, Stripe's fee is "2.9% + 30Â¢ per successful card charged", which is fantastic, and that's what all you'll be paying using Apazed. Well, unless you upgrade to that Pro plan.

The paid upgrade is just one way we're going to make this work. The main way, is by bootstrapping this whole thing, just like you're doing for you're own business. <u>So, why not join others and do this together?</u>
