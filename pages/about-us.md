Our main goal is to help those without the development knowledge or the engineering team to start getting paid *without any additional fees*. You can upgrade to our paid [Pro plan](https://apazed.com/pricing) if you need more advanced features, but we're not going to bait and switch you into upgrading. All the features you need to get started are available for you now and forever, **for free!**

Prior to founding Apazed, he built and ran Sprout Invoices, an invoicing solution for WordPress sites. In early 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic changed the face of ecommerce, he was inspired to create a payment solution for businesses that were just starting to sell their products online, as well as businesses looking for a simpler payment solution. Thus, Apazed was born. When he's not cooking up new features, he loves watching baseball—so much that you may find some easter eggs

What can we say? We simply hire the best people... even if those people are cephalopods. Zelda's focus is on customer satisfaction, and she regularly contributes <a href="/articles/" class="flex items-center justify-start mt-8 text-md font-medium tracking-wide text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-200 underline">articles</a> to our site.

## What's the deal with no fees?

We don't care what they say—Apazed is committed to proving that it's possible to create a sustainable business that connects payment providers and site owners **without** any added fees. These fees just undercut what little margin online sellers already have. Currently, Stripe's fee is "2.9% + 30¢ per successful card swipe, which is fantastic. And that's all you'll be paying with Apazed. Well, unless you upgrade to that monthly Pro plan.

The paid upgrade is just one way we're going to make this work. The main way is by bootstrapping this whole thing, just like you're doing with you're own business. [Get Apazed now and let's do this together!](https://apazed.com/pricing)
